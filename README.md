# React + Vite

Description:

1- I used Vite because by combining React and Vite, i get a fast development environment that allows me to instantly visualize changes in the browser, it eliminates the waiting time between making a code change and seeing the result.

2- Kindle run "npm install" and "npm run dev" to start the project

3- The following are what i have used to complete this project:

    - React hooks to store the input data in a state
    - Evergreen UI library for UI elements
    - Axios to communicate between services

4- I have stored variables that i use more often in a file called GlobalVar.js

NOTE: - Total time spent on this application (frontend): 1.5 hours including debugging

Thanks for your time!
